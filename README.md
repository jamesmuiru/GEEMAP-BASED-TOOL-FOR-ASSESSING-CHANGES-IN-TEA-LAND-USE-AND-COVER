# GEEMAP-BASED-TOOL-FOR-ASSESSING-CHANGES-IN-TEA-LAND-USE-AND-COVER
The tool for detecting tea-related land use and land cover (LULC) changes in Kericho County is built using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the geemap Python library. It processes satellite imagery (Landsat 8) to classify land cover types like tea plantations, forests, and built-up areas. Using machine learning classification (Random Forest), the tool tracks spatial and temporal changes in land cover over a decade (2014â€“2024), providing interactive visualizations and detailed change detection maps.
